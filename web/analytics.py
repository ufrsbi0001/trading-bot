"""
analytics.py — Accurate trade analytics module for the bot's UI.

Provides SAME data as history.py's 4 CSVs, but kept IN MEMORY
(no CSV files written). Served via app.py's /api/analytics/* routes
and consumed by the existing /api/history and /api/history/detailed
endpoints for accurate UI display.

Data is refreshed by a background worker every 5 minutes.
Uses bot's existing Binance client (no extra session).

REV 1.7 (2026-09-28) — FALLBACK LOOP CONSISTENCY FIX:
  ✅ _fetch_income_window_fallback() was still using the OLD
     `for _ in range(MAX_PAGES)` pattern that REV 1.5 fixed in
     _fetch_fills() and _fetch_orders(). A rate-limit `continue`
     in that loop consumed a MAX_PAGES slot (10 back-to-back RLs
     = 10 slots gone). Functionally the retry still worked because
     `cursor` was not advanced, but it silently ate into the page
     budget. Rewrote as `while page < MAX_PAGES` with an explicit
     `page` counter that increments ONLY on a successful fetch —
     matching the pattern used by all three other paginators.
  ✅ Added explicit warning log when MAX_PAGES is exhausted with
     data still pending (cursor < end_ms). Previously the function
     returned truncated results silently.

REV 1.6 (2026-09-28) — SILENT CLIENT-WAIT FOR WORKER:
  ✅ Background worker no longer logs "[WARNING] refresh failed:
     no client" when it starts before the user has clicked Start
     in the UI. The worker now polls get_client() quietly and only
     begins its refresh cycle once the client is available. Startup
     gets a single INFO line instead of a WARNING every 5s until
     the UI is used.
  ✅ refresh_now() returns False silently (no warning, no mutation
     of last_error) when the client is not yet set — callers can
     still distinguish success (True) from not-ready-or-failed
     (False), and last_error is only populated for REAL failures.
  ✅ schedule_refresh() is a silent no-op when the client is not
     set — avoids spawning a thread that would immediately fail.

REV 1.5 (2026-09-26) — FILLS/ORDERS RATE-LIMIT PAGE-SKIP FIX:
  ✅ _fetch_fills() and _fetch_orders() had the SAME class of bug
     that was fixed in _fetch_income_window() at REV 1.4: the loop
     was `for _ in range(MAX_PAGES)` and a rate-limit `continue`
     incremented the loop counter, so the failed page was never
     retried — its 1000 records were silently dropped, causing
     fills/orders to be truncated mid-window on rate limit.
     Rewrote both as explicit while-loops with a consecutive-rate-
     limit counter that does NOT advance the page index on -1003/
     -1015, and bails out after 10 consecutive rate limits.
  ✅ Hardcoded `1000` replaced with PAGE_SIZE constant in
     _fetch_income_window() and _fetch_income_window_fallback()
     (single source of truth for the page size).

REV 1.4 (2026-09-26) — PAGINATION ROBUSTNESS:
  ✅ RATE-LIMIT PAGE-SKIP FIX in _fetch_income_window().
  ✅ AUTO-FALLBACK ON SILENT PAGE-PARAM IGNORE.
  ✅ PROBE STILL PRESENT (kept for logging only).

REV 1.3 (2026-09-26) — ALIGNED WITH history.py REV 3.7:
  ✅ INCOME PAGINATION FIX (cursor = last_time, no +1).
  ✅ FLIP realizedPnl ATTRIBUTION FIX.
  ✅ CROSS-CHECK PARITY (FROM TRADES includes open commissions/funding).
  ✅ PAGE-SUPPORT PROBE.
  ✅ PER-SYMBOL DRIFT DIAGNOSTIC.
  ✅ _scale_fills() helper kept.
  ✅ _pair_fills() semantics identical to history.py REV 3.3.

REV 1.2 (2026-09-26) — aligned with history.py REV 3.3.
REV 1.1 (2026-09-24) — double-fetch fix.
REV 1.0 (2026-09-24) — initial release.

      "no client" and was logged as a WARNING every cycle until
      Start was clicked.

      New behaviour:
        Phase 1 — Quiet poll of get_client() every 1s. A single
                  INFO line is emitted the first time we enter the
                  waiting state; nothing else is logged until the
                  client appears.
        Phase 2 — Once the client exists, enter the normal refresh
                  cycle. Errors during this phase are real errors
                  and still get WARNING-level logging.
